Open Source Projects and Competitions
======
* Simplicial Homology Global Optimization (2016-present)
    * A new global optimization algorithm specialized in solving, efficient local minima mapping and characterization of black and grey box objective functions by utilizing techniques from integral homology theory.
    * Project website: [https://stefan-endres.github.io/shgo/](https://stefan-endres.github.io/shgo/)
    * Written for the [SciPy project](https://www.scipy.org/)
(2015)
* Hyperct (2017-present)
    * Library for low memory mesh grids, hypercube triangulations and sub-triangulations.
    * Project website: [https://github.com/Stefan-Endres/hyperct](https://github.com/Stefan-Endres/hyperct)
* Topographical global optimization (2016)
    * An open source Python implementation of the iterative topographical global optimization method.
    * Project website: [https://github.com/Stefan-Endres/tgo](https://github.com/Stefan-Endres/tgo)
* Sci-X (team member), SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition Finalist (2015-2016)
    * Designed the full thermodynamic cycles which powered the air bearings by compressing vacuum air and performed FEM heat transfer analysis of the hyperloop pod using ANSYS.
